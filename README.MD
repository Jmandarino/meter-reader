# Seven segment display reader (Meter Reader)

## Purpose:

To read the data from Coned Electric meters (7 segment displays) and graph the information

### Workflow:

1. Grab meter image
2. process image (grabbing digit display)
3. run data through MNIST and SVM/KNN
4. Graph data and find trends


### TOOLS:
1. opencv
2. sklearn
3. MNIST Dataset
4. Matplotlib 

### MAJOR TODO's :

1. Connect user flows (processing img -> figure out image -> graph)
2. Error Processing for (OCR)
2. Grab EXIF data from picture
3. Error Processing for data (if ocr failed to read data correctly what should we do
